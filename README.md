# Pneumonia X-ray Classification


### Motitvation
- With pneumonia being the second most misdiagnosed disease I thought this could be help and better the odds for peole who have pneumonina.  Comupters can recognize patterns very very well so I thought I woul use the tool that I have aquired to try and classifiy pneumonia patients x-rays and classifiy them to either have it or not.

### Objectives
- Classify x-rays from pneumonia patients with highest accuracy


### Model
- Convolutional Neural Network

### Recommendations
- Always double check with a doctor if running live test
- Get more data to get the highest accuracy possible
- Use Neural Networks more in healthcare
